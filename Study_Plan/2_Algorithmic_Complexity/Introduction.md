# Algorithmic Complexity
An algorithm with low performance can significantly degrade the responsiveness and scalability of applications, resulting in slower execution times, increased resource consumption, and a poor user experience. As systems and data grow in size and complexity, the performance of an algorithm can become a critical bottleneck. Addessing performance issues is not just a matter of optimizing a code, it requires a deep understanding of algorithmic complexity and the inherent trade-offs between different approaches.

Software engineers **must** have the ability to identify, analyze and optimize performance issues.
