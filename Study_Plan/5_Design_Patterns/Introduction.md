# Design Patterns

### What's a Design Pattern?
**Design patterns** are standard solutions to frequently encountered challenges in software design.
Think of them as customizable frameworks that help address recurring design issues in your code.

Unlike pre-built functions or libraries that you can directly integrate into your program, design patterns aren't specific pieces of code. Instead, they offer a general approach to solving a given problem. You can adapt the principles of a pattern to craft a solution tailored to the specifics of your own project.

Patterns are sometimes mistaken for algorithms because both represent typical approaches to solving problems. However, algorithms provide a precise sequence of steps to achieve a specific outcome, whereas patterns offer a broader, more abstract solution. The implementation of the same pattern can vary between different programs.

### What does the pattern consist of?
Most patternsare documented in a formal manner to ensure they can be applied across various situations. A typical pattern description includes the following sections:

* **Intent**: Provides a concise overview of the problem the pattern addresses and the solution it offers.

* **Motivation**: Delves deeper into the problem and explains how the pattern's solution addresses it.

* **Structure of Classes**: Illustrates the components of the pattern and their interconnections.

* **Code Example**: Offers a sample implementation in a popular programming language to clarify how the pattern can be applied.

### Classification of patterns
Design patterns vary in therms of their complexity, the level of detail they provide, and their scope of application within the overall system. Despite that, all patterns can be categorized by their intent or purpose. The three primary groups of patterns are:

* **Creational**: offers various methods for creating objects, enhancing flexibility and reusability of code.

* **Structural**: addresses how to organize and assemble objects and classes into larger structures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

* **Behavioral**: manages the effective communication and responsibility distribution among objects.
