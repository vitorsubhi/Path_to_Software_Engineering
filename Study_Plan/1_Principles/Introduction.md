# Principles of Software Engineering
In software development, adhering to well-established principles can significantly enhance the maintainability, readability, and flexibility of your code. Below is an introduction to some key principles.

## KISS, DRY, YAGNI and Low Coupling
### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
The KISS principle emphasizes the importance of simplicity in software design. It suggests that systems and solutions should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity. By keeping designs straightforward, you reduce the potential for bugs, make the code easier to understand, and simplify future modifications. The principle essentially advocates for the creation of solutions that are easy to understand and maintain.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
The DRY principle focuses on reducing duplication within code. It encourages developers to avoid repeating code and instead to abstract and reuse code wherever possible. This principle helps in making the codebase more modular and maintainable, as changes only need to be made in one place. By adhering to DRY, you minimize redundancy, reduce the risk of inconsistencies, and enhance code reusability.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
The YAGNI principle is about avoiding the implementation of features or functionality that you don’t currently need. It’s a reminder to focus on the present requirements and not to over-engineer or build features based on speculative future needs. By following YAGNI, you ensure that your development efforts are concentrated on actual requirements, which helps in keeping the codebase lean and focused.

### Low Coupling
Low coupling refers to the practice of designing software components so that they have minimal dependencies on each other. This principle encourages creating modules or classes that interact through well-defined interfaces and are less reliant on the internal workings of other components. By achieving low coupling, you make your code more modular, easier to understand, and more resilient to changes, as modifications to one component are less likely to impact others.

## SOLID Principles
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing you to add new functionality without changing existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program, ensuring that derived classes can stand in for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use, advocating for smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general ones.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
